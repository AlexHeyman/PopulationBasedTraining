# PopulationBasedTraining
An implementation of population-based training of neural networks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09846.pdf) for TensorFlow, with associated testing materials.

This implementation was originally written for TensorFlow v1, but has been updated to run with TensorFlow v2.3.1 using its backwards compatibility features.
